    text: (

        <Typography paragraph>
          The base year stands for the current year you are in, specifically the
          Trailing Twelve Months (TTM). The reason why we use the TTM and not
          the annual financial results is because it's the most up to date
          financial information for the company.
        </Typography>
        <Typography paragraph>
          1, 2, 3... 10 stands for the subsequent yearly data. For example if
          you are valuing a company on the 21st November 2020 and the most
          recent TTM data was last released on the 20th October 2020 then next
          year (C1) will be from 21st November 2020 to 21st November 2021 and
          the same for the next years after that. So the years represent the
          subsequent years <b>after</b> the most recent financial results were
          released and not when you are doing the DCF.
        </Typography>
        <Typography paragraph>
          The terminal year is all of the years after year 10 up to infinity.
          It's not possible to model that far out into the future and even 10
          years is hard so we just assign a terminal year to solve this as best
          we can. The reason why it works doing it forever is because the
          discount rate eventually makes the termianl value worthless after so
          many years.

          The revenue growth rate is one of the main value drivers that really
          affects the estimated value per share. So it is really important that
          you choose a realistic growth rate for your DCF. We provide an input

          Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) is the average growth rate that you
          think will happen for the company from year 1-5 (B2-G2). We then use
          this as the revenue growth for years 1-5. To figure out what to put in
          this input you need to check the companies previous revenue growth
          rates, the industry average compared to year 10 reveue growth and also
          your thoughts on the future of the company.
        </Typography>
        <Typography paragraph>
          From years 6-10 (H2-L2) we slightly reduce the growth rate each year.
          This is to safe guard you against putting in an unreasonably large
          revenue growth rate. It's also more realistic in most cases due to
          companies growth slowing as their revenue becomes bigger and the
          company matures. The terminal growth (M2) is then set to be equal year
          10's growth rate.

          We use this input in Years 1-10 (B4-L4) and set the terminal year to
          be equal to year 10 (L4). To figure out what to put in this input you
          need to check the companies current EBIT margin, the industries
          average EBIT margin and also your thoughts on what type of margin the
          company can acheive by year 10. This will differ grealy depending on

          The EBIT Margin will slowly converge from the base years margin (B4)

        The tax rate in the base year is set to be the effective tax rate for
        your company. This tax rate then converges to the marginal tax rate
        after year 5 (H6). The reason we converge from the effective tax rate to
        the marginal is because a company cannot defer it's taxes forever,
        eventually the company has to pay the countries marginal corporation tax
        rate.

              because it's credit rating is Aaa. The UK has a credit rating of
              AA2 which is lower than the US, it therefore has a crp of 0.73%.
              So the UK's erp is 5.96%. Investors demand more return for

                Cost of Capital (WACC)&nbsp;
              </Box>
              - The total cost of raising capital for the company weighted by
              the type of capital it raises, i.e equity, debt or preferred
              stock. For example, if a company raises 80% of it's capital in
              equity then the weight for equity will be set to 80% as equity
              would have more of an affect on the cost of the capital.

        a company (which is captured in the Cost of Capital).
